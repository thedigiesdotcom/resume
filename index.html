I also helped ensure smooth customs clearance, making sure goods passed through international borders without delays or extra costs.
<br><br>Additionally, I often arranged cargo insurance to protect shipments against loss, damage, or theft during transit. Sometimes, I also managed warehousing or consolidated smaller shipments into larger ones to save money.
